# Classes to Skip During Code Generation
# This file defines which AUTOSAR classes should NOT be generated by tools/generate_models.py
#
# Classes listed here are manually maintained and should not be overwritten by the generator.
#
# Common reasons to skip a class:
# - Base classes that require custom serialization logic (e.g., ARObject, AUTOSAR)
# - Classes with complex decorator patterns that can't be auto-generated
# - Classes with hand-optimized implementations

skip_classes:
  # Root AUTOSAR element - manually maintained
  - "AUTOSAR"

  # Base ARObject class - implements reflection-based serialization framework
  - "ARObject"
